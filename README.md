VIII.	Final conclusion: 
State provides information about incontinence products, max units and diagnosis requirements. 
Max Units: Although, state specifies max units of individual CPTs but it also mentioned in 2009 documents that they will allows providers to bill bigger quantities within 180 days for refill. Although these documents are old but they are still referenced in some of the new state documents. We need to be lenient in deciding max units quantities so that claims do not get denied on monthly basis. 
Diagnosis Requirement: State specifies diagnosis codes which are required to be included in claim for billing incontinence products. State also specifies the number of products that can be billed for each diagnosis code. 

There is scope for creating more than one rule here. 

IX.	Logic: 

1.	If the following incontinence product codes are billed by any provider with greater than 2121 combined units in 180 days, then deny additional units with reason Adjusted Units Because They Exceeded The Amount Allowed. Codes: A4554, T4537, T4540
2.	If the following incontinence product codes are billed by any provider with greater than 1750 combined units in 180 days, then deny additional units with reason Adjusted Units Because They Exceeded The Amount Allowed. Codes: T4521-T4533, T4535, T4539 
3.	If any of the following incontinence product codes is billed and an appropriate diagnosis code is not submitted on the claim header then deny the line with reason The Diagnosis Codes On The Claim Do Not Support The Billed Procedure Code. 
HCPCS: A4554, T4521, T4522, T4523, T4524, T4529, T4530, T4533, T4535, T4537, T4539, T4540, and T4543 
ICD: N39.41, N39.3, N39.46, N39.42, N39.43, N39.44, N39.45, N39.490, R39.81, N39.3, R15.9, R15.0, R15.1, R15.2
4.	If incontinence products are billed by any provider and patients age is more than or equal to 3 years then deny the billed code with reason inappropriate billing. HCPCS: A4554, T4521, T4522, T4523, T4524, T4529, T4530, T4533, T4535, T4537, T4539, T4540, and T4543.











Or
5.	If disposable incontinence product codes (T4521, T4522, T4523, T4524, T4529, T4530, T4533, T4535, T4543) are billed in any combination by any provider with greater than 250 units in 28 days, then deny additional units with reason Adjusted Units Because They Exceeded The Amount Allowed.
6.	If reusable incontinence product codes (T4537, T4539, T4540) are billed in any combination by any provider with greater than 5 units in 28 days, then deny additional units with reason Adjusted Units Because They Exceeded The Amount Allowed.
7.	If disposable incontinence product codes (A4554, A4335) is/are billed in any combination by any provider with greater than 300 units in 28 days, then deny additional units with reason Adjusted Units Because They Exceeded The Amount Allowed.
*A4335 has max units 30.
